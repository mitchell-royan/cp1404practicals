# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually fairly accurate apart from a few outliers.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

The accuracy did slightly improve although some still took longer then expected.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That sometimes writing a program will take longer then you think.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

That I miss simple things like docstrings quite regularly.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

That there is always something you can improve on and learn from.


### Good Code Review 1

[Good Code Review 1](https://github.com/jd111696/cp1404practicals/pull/3#event-20967519042)

### Explanation

Throughout this code review, even though the code was at a high standard, I still found some improvements on the code
(even if the program already runs/works). The main comment was including exception handling to catch FileNotFound errors
since the program currently just assumed the file exists. As well as suggesting the implementation of another error 
checking loop to handle ValueError. 

### Good Code Review 2

[Good Code Review 2](https://github.com/PlasticStrawActivist/cp1404practicals/pull/1#pullrequestreview-3408669389)

### Explanation

Throughout this code review, the main suggestions I made were based off of naming, however I also suggested the use of 
a try except loop to handle KeyErrors. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Shortening some of the practicals (specifically practical 07), as the project management program felt more like an 
assignment then a weekly prac it was that long.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Submitted them on time, and commit quality.
